# Azure Terraform Repo

This repo has simple TF code to deploy a virtual machine on Azure in a public subnet. State file is local at the moment and some of the component is added in .gitignore file. 

Most of the content is part of this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-for-azure/) by <em>Derek Mogran </em>. I would highly recommend this course for a quick start guide on using <em>Terraform in Azure</em>

This is a working repo and I will keep adding content to it every now and then. Branch protection has been enabled on main branch.
